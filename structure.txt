| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | Load knowledge from file                 | File handling, JSON            |
| 2    | Take user input and give a response      | Conditionals, input/output     |
| 3    | Loop the chat until user quits           | While loops                    |
| 4    | Handle unknown inputs smartly            | Error handling, fallback logic |
| 5    | Log each chat to `chatlog.txt`           | File write, appending          |
| 6    | Add new knowledge dynamically | File write, dictionary updates |
| 7    | Use functions and refactor               | Functions, code reuse          |
| 8    | Use OOP (later phase)                    | Classes, self, encapsulation   |
